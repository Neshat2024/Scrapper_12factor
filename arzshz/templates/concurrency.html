                <p>Any computer program, once run, is represented by one or more processes. Web apps have taken a
                    variety of process-execution forms. For example, PHP processes run as child processes of Apache,
                    started on demand as needed by request volume. Java processes take the opposite approach, with the
                    JVM providing one massive uberprocess that reserves a large block of system resources (CPU and
                    memory) on startup, with concurrency managed internally via threads. In both cases, the running
                    process(es) are only minimally visible to the developers of the app.</p>
                <p><img alt="Scale is expressed as running processes, workload diversity is expressed as process types."
                        src="/images/process-types.png"/></p>
                <p><strong>In the twelve-factor app, processes are a first class citizen.</strong> Processes in the
                    twelve-factor app take strong cues from <a
                            href="https://adam.herokuapp.com/past/2011/5/9/applying_the_unix_process_model_to_web_apps/">the
                        unix process model for running service daemons</a>. Using this model, the developer can
                    architect their app to handle diverse workloads by assigning each type of work to a <em>process
                        type</em>. For example, HTTP requests may be handled by a web process, and long-running
                    background tasks handled by a worker process.</p>
                <p>This does not exclude individual processes from handling their own internal multiplexing, via threads
                    inside the runtime VM, or the async/evented model found in tools such as <a
                            href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine">EventMachine</a>, <a
                            href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a>, or <a
                            href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. But an individual VM can only grow so large (vertical
                    scale), so the application must also be able to span multiple processes running on multiple physical
                    machines.</p>
                <p>The process model truly shines when it comes time to scale out. The <a href="./processes">share-nothing,
                    horizontally partitionable nature of twelve-factor app processes</a> means that adding more
                    concurrency is a simple and reliable operation. The array of process types and number of processes
                    of each type is known as the <em>process formation</em>.</p>
                <p>Twelve-factor app processes <a href="http://dustin.github.com/2010/02/28/running-processes.html">should
                    never daemonize</a> or write PID files. Instead, rely on the operating systemâ€™s process manager
                    (such as <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a>, a distributed
                    process manager on a cloud platform, or a tool like <a
                            href="http://blog.daviddollar.org/2011/05/06/introducing-foreman.html">Foreman</a> in
                    development) to manage <a href="./logs">output streams</a>, respond to crashed processes, and handle
                    user-initiated restarts and shutdowns.</p>
